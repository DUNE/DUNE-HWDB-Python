Documentation for the Sisyphus API can be generated automatically using the 
pydoc module. I have been trying to add docstrings for modules, classes, and
functions that I think might be useful to others, but I've only covered maybe
30% of what I have intended to do.

To generate documentation through pydoc, call the following command:

    python -m pydoc -wb Sisyphus

This should start an HTTP server on your local machine and open a web browser
to the Sisyphus index page.
